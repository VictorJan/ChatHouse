A web application for secure end-to-end encrypted real time conversations , with storing capabilities. Moreover the app supports a secure authentication (which is token based) process - which involves 2 factor authentication ,as for creating an account/logging in. Moreover a user is to be allowed to safely change the state of the account - the password, or even discharge/delete the account - by relying on the additional verification step , mentioned before.

Let's talk about the security in the IAA - Identification Authentication Authorization, itself. When somebody wishes to sign up/sign in - they shall be identified based on the initial goal, by providing necessary credentials. Then an email be sent to the provided email address, if the goal was to sign up (respectively carrying out a check for the absence of an already registered email address) otherwise based on the provided identification - assuming the goal was to sign up.
The email itself contains a verification token - which is valid for several minutes , which is also revoked after a successful use.
The verification token - allows a user to resume to the next step - password submission - the Authentication step in the login flow. After having submited a password - a user then is presented with a JWT grant token, which could be used to fetch authorized views - pages and access tokens , which on their own are used to make Authorized actions regarding searching,creating and updating data.

Running on your own.
In order to run this application one would have to provide necessary configuration details for the config.json - regarding the STATIC_KEY - a static key for signing the JWT tokens  , then MAIL_USERNAME and MAIL_PASSWORD - email credentials , and DH_GENERATOR,DH_MODULUS - Diffie Hellman protocol parameters.
